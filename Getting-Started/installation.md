# Installation

## Install

### With SSH Access \(Cloud Server/SSH for Shared Hositng\)

There's a few options here. First, you can always use [**Composer**](https://getcomposer.org/download/) via the command line:

```
composer require adaptcms/adaptcms
```

You can also grab the latest version, at any time below:

```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/adaptcms/latest.zip && unzip latest.zip
```

Or if you would like to get the newest stable version:

```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/adaptcms/stable.zip && unzip latest.zip
```

### No SSH Access \(Shared Hosting\)

So, assuming your PHP version is newer than 5.6.4 you can simply download one of the ZIP files below:

**Stable**

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/adaptcms/stable.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/adaptcms/stable.zip)

**Latest**

[https://s3.amazonaws.com/adaptcms/latest.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/adaptcms/latest.zip)

Then simply unzip the contents of the file locally. For the next step, you need a FTP client. We recommend:
