# Requirements

Below you will find the requirements necessary to run AdaptCMS Alpha. Since the CMS is using modern technologies, the versions of software required are newer than normal. The good news is, outside of the ZIP PHP extension, all the requirements are based on L[**aravel**](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4#server-requirements).

* PHP &gt;= 5.6.4
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* ZIP PHP Extension \(for installation of plugins/themes and upgrades inside the Admin\)
* MySQL Server/Client \(support for more database types coming soon\)
* Apache, NGINX
* URL Rewriting enabled \(mod\_rewrite, try\_files, etc\)
