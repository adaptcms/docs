# Creating Your Own Package

### Creating the Package

### Package Options

#### Vue Plugin File\(s\)

You may create a plugin or numerous plugins inside your package's UI folder. In the UI folder simply create a folder called `plugins` and any JS files in this folder will be autoloaded and globally usable. Please use Vue conventions to have this plugin able to be registered. Users may see an example in the Base package here:

```text
/packages/Adaptcms/Base/ui/plugins/Base.js
```
