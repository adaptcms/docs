# Introduction

The dream of AdaptCMS is a content management system that is like a sandbox. To be able to build any type of site you want and if you're a developer, to be able to create additional functionality easily.

We do this by implementing a modular system that allows us, as well as developers to quickly be able to build plugins, fields, and other types of content. Our upcoming new version continues the tradition of using Laravel and VueJS, but what really makes a difference this time around is using TailwindCSS for the UI and InertiaJS for quickly building web pages.

At the time of this writing, a beta version is in the works and will be complimented with the documentation listed here so any developer may use the CMS.
