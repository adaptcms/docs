# About

The dream of AdaptCMS is a content management system that is like a sandbox. To be able to build any type of site you want and if you're a developer, to be able to create additional functionality easily.

We try to do this by first, creating a solid "framework" of sorts. You can install/upgrade/update plugins, themes and the CMS itself, in the admin. The latest and best software is used, including the Laravel PHP framework, Semantic UI CSS framework, VueJS 2 framework and others.

This first Alpha version is early on and we have a lot of exciting things planned. So stay tuned and see below for contact info, feel free to ask for help or give us feedback any time!
