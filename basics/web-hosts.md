## Hosts Not Supported

You should probably avoid these. It doesn't mean it's not possible, but will likely require support tickets to enabled PHP modules like \`mcrypt\`, \`mbstring\`, and so on, as well as CLI support.

* Go Daddy - [http://godaddy.com](http://godaddy.com\) - doesn't meet server requirements
* NameCheap - [http://namecheap.com](http://namecheap.com\)
* Rackspace Cloud - [http://www.rackspace.com/cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/\) - issues with out-of-sync file timestamps and permissions
* 1and1.com - [http://1and1.com](http://1and1.com\) - please [see here](https://github.com/statamic/hosts/issues/12) for more details.
