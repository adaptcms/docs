# Plugins

Like Fields, Plugins reside in the root `/packages` folder. Unlike fields, plugins are like mini-apps within your site. UI vue components, routes, controllers, models, commands - anything that Laravel supports is usable within a plugin. They could be used to add a feature, or to add a layer to the CMS fit for the specific website in mind.

When creating, or editing a plugin, there is an option to "Publish". As long as a valid GitHub URL is entered, we will update that GitHub repo with the files that reside in the Plugin path.

Another feature is the ability to search for a plugin from the AdaptCMS.com Marketplace. You may view the plugin on the marketplace, or even choose to install it directly to your website.
